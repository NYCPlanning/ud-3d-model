# NYC 3D Model

This repository contains scripts used by the Urban Design division to generate the [NYC 3D Model](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-nyc-3d-model-download.page). Tutorials on how to work with the model are published separately as part of the DCP Parametric Tools project and are available [here](https://nycplanning.github.io/ud-parametric-tools/nycmodel/tutorials.html).

Over time, we'll want to have these available in a centrally hosted location.
